What I learned from today: 

Where I"m still a little weak, to be mindful of for sprint:
- Filter and how it's used
- this
- I still get the console warning A component is changing an uncontrolled input of type text to be controlled...

I think we narrowed things down, solidified knowledge, confirmed some principles and left somewhat of a trail for sprint. That should be done more conscientiously in the future for ease of Fridays.
